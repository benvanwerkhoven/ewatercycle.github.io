# Personas

*As a way to confirm that we meet our goals and that the system we designed will indeed be useful to the hydrology community we created 4 personas that will use eWatercycle II: PhD student, Old Professor, Deltares consultant and Red Cross logistic manager. These personas have abstract use-cases as well as concrete use cases that are based on each personaâ€™s needs. We will also approach the scientific community to provide us with (published) articles that could have benefited from the project.*

## The PhD student


![right-aligned-image](/assets/phdstudent.png){: .align-right}

Femke is a PhD environmental science student in Luik university. She has a MsC in environmental science. She would like to have a modeling PhD and publish 4 papers.
She will focus on modeling trees, i.e., % of trees per unit area, amount of water that is captured in different types of trees and their effect on the water balance in their surrounding.

**Research Question:** 

How much water is retained by different trees, how does it affect water balance in the region? Ultimate goal is to improve/create a model that best represent reality and to expand it to global scale.


**What can eWatercycle do for her?**
eWaterCycle offers a platform that already has the model and an environment to run the model. We will provide global data (thus the PhD student will not have to spend the time and effort that contacting the community and collecting the data will usually involve).  eWaterCycle will provide a visual environment where the student can analyze the results and compare the models she used. 

**Currently, it would usually take months to run the model (find the relevant data, understand and adjust the configuration file, actually succeed to run the model and finally analyze the results). Using eWaterCycle II it would take her a few days and she could access many more models, and compare them for the region in question.**
